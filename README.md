# tracker
_Do Not checkin src code to this repo_

The **Tracker** repo will be used to Organize, Plan, Track Issues and Work items for terra-rebels's software engineering teams. The Architects squad has chosen ZenHub as the Project Management tool. Zenhub will help your teams get more work done faster with time-saving agile automations, fewer meetings, and more visibility in GitHub.

### Install and Set Up Zenhub

- Request @terra-rebels/architects to give you access to The TR Engineering Zenhub workspace

- Download and install Zenhub Browser Extension from https://www.zenhub.com/extension

- Ensure you are not in incognito mode while using ZenHub

### Why use a separate tracker repo?
   A common tracker repo outside of the main code repos will help centralize tracking items, and most importantly, bring public visibility into Terra Rebels Project Management for all stakeholders of LUNC and USTC. It also helps external teams (non-developer teams â€” i.e. operations, validators) to create and track work through a sprint. This will help PM and PO across teams keep track of what's going on at any given time and provide enough data to design roadmaps for future release.
