The Tracker repo will be used to Track Issues and Work items for terra-rebels. The Architects team as decided to use ZenHub has the choosen Project Management tool. Zenhub will helps your teams get more work done faster with time-saving agile automations, fewer meetings, and more visibility in GitHub.

- Download and install Zenhub Browser Externsion from https://www.zenhub.com/extension

### Why a separate tracker repo u may ask.
   A common tracker repo outside of the main code repos will help centralize tracking items and also helps external teams, Non developer teams (Operations, validators) to create and track work through a sprint. This will help PM and PO across teams to keep track of whats going on at any given time.
